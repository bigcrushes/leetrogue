# LeetRogue

## Steps to run:
1. Run `python app.py` to start the backend
2. `cd leetrogue`
3. Run `npm start` to start the frontend

## Inspiration
We were inspired by the game of the year - Balatro, a rogue-like poker game and thought that it'd fit well for a rogue-like LeetCode game. It presents a new challenge to LeetCode to solve them in unique, more innovative ways, making LeetCoding more fun for everyone.

## What it does
You are given varying number of aura points for solving each question which you can use to unlock more if loops, for loops or import statements. How will you spend them? Should you save your aura points for more expensive upgrades or use them now? Can you come up with innovative solutions amidst these constraints? That's the beauty of LeetRogue. Even if you think that they've played these games before, can you overcome this new and MASSIVE challenge that we have in store?

## How we built it
The frontend is built on React and calls a backend running on Flask. We then styled the application using the Material UI library and in-line CSS.

## Challenges we ran into
It was our first time using flask and trying to build a code editor was not an easy feat with much fewer resources that other projects. Trying to make a LeetCode style web app with test cases and questions made it even harder.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite the fear and initial discouragement, we powered through with our limited knowledge with hard work to build a final working prototype - something we didn't think we'd accomplish. Everyone in the team stayed up late to push through ;)

## What we learned
We learnt more about full-stack development and creating our very own browser code editor. Additionally, we learnt the challenges of exploring and researching topics that were unfamiliar to us and employing these technologies within a short frame of time.

## What's next for LeetRogue
More questions, more things to buy in the shop and more fun!
